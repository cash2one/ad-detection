# ad-detection

The goal of this project is to automate the process behind [Sleeping Giants](https://twitter.com/slpng_giants). The goal is to use a browser to open various hate speech sites and identify each of the ads and capture a screenshot and the corresponding advertiser.

This information is then surfaced on a simple site, currently at [http://sleeping-giants.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/](http://sleeping-giants.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) that gives people a way to get a screenshot and bring it to the attention of the advertiser.
